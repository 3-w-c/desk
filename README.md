# â—²  desk

Lightweight workspace manager for the shell. 

Desk makes it easy to flip back and forth between different project contexts in
your favorite shell. 

Instead of relying on `CTRL-R` to execute and recall ("that command's gotta
be here somewhere..."), desk helps shorten and document those actions with
shell aliases and functions.

There are no dependencies other than some kind of Unix shell.

For example, given this deskfile
```sh
# Description: desk for doing work on a terraform-based repository
#

cd ~/terraform-repo

# Set up AWS env variables: <key id> <secret>
set_aws_env() {
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="$1"
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="$2"
}

# Run `terraform plan` with proper AWS var config
plan() {
  terraform plan -module-depth=-1 \
    -var "access_key=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" \
    -var "secret_key=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
}
 
# Run `terraform apply` with proper AWS var config
alias apply='terraform apply'
```

we'd get 

```sh
$ desk . tf
$ desk

tf
desk for doing work on a terraform repo

  set_aws_env - Set up AWS env variables: <key id> <secret>
  plan - Run `terraform plan` with proper AWS var config
  apply - Run `terraform apply` with proper AWS var config
```
 
Basically, desk just associates a shell script (`name.sh`) with a name. When
you call `desk . name`, desk drops you into a shell where `name.sh` has been
executed, and then desk extracts out certain comments in `name.sh` for useful
rendering.
          
### Installing

0. `git clone <this repo>`
0. `sudo make install` or `cp desk/desk ~/bin/desk`
0. `desk init`

### Deskfile rules

Deskfiles are just shell scripts, nothing more. Desk does pay attention 
to certain kinds of comments, though.

- *description*: you can describe a deskfile by including `# Description: ...`
  somewhere in the file.

- *alias and function docs*: if the line above an alias or function is a 
  comment, it will be used as documentation.

### Sharing deskfiles across computers

Of course, the desk config directory (by default `~/.desks`) can be a symlink
so that deskfiles can be stored in some centralized place, like Dropbox,
and so shared across many computers.
